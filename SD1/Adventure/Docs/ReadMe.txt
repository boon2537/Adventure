Deep Learning:
There were several times that I had to go back to the engine code to fix a long lasting bugs that I've somehow never discovered in Incursion.
I also had to go back to and many quality of life improvements for engine code. Making my own engine definitely makes me more deliberate with my code,
since any shortcuts or mistakes I make will eventually hit me in future projects. I remember waiting for an Unity update to fix a crucial bug. 
Now, with my own engine, the responsibility of fixing engine bugs is in my hand; I hope that those bugs will be easy to fix.
